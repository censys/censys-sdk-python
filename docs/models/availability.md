# Availability

If an attack renders information unavailable, such as when a system crashes or through a DDoS attack, availability is negatively impacted. Availability has three possible values: None (N) – There is no loss of availability, Low (L) – Availability might be intermittently limited, or performance might be negatively impacted, as a result of a successful attack, High (H) – There is a complete loss of availability of the impacted system or information.
